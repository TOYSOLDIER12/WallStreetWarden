ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A classic time series forecasting algorithm that takes into account the past values and the error terms.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that's great for capturing patterns in sequential data, like stock prices.
Prophet: Developed by Facebook, this algorithm is designed for forecasting time series data with seasonal patterns.
Now, for the Python libraries, you've got a few fookin' options:

pandas: Essential for data wrangling and manipulation. You'll be usin' this to handle your stock data like a fookin' pro.
scikit-learn: Your go-to for machine learning in Python. It's got implementations of various algorithms, including ARIMA and LSTM.
TensorFlow or PyTorch: If you're goin' down the deep learning route with LSTM or other neural networks, these libraries got your back.
Prophet: If you fancy givin' Prophet a spin, it's available as a Python package too.
With these tools in your arsenal, you'll be well-equipped to tackle the wild world of gold stock prediction. Just remember, mate, the market's a fookin' beast, so don't go bettin' the farm on your predictions!
